## About Reader

This is my graduation project from web devevlopment bootcamp at neuefische Hamburg: A distraction free reader. You can test it [here](https://cheyder.uber.space) (no guarantee for permanent storage of any user data so far). 

The crawler works at the moment mainly with wikipedia sites, therefore I suggest you to test it with one of these.
