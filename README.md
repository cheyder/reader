## About Reader

This is my graduation project from web devevlopment bootcamp at neuefische Hamburg: A distraction free reader. You can test it [here](https://cheyder.uber.space) (no guarantee for permanent storage of any user data so far). 

The crawler works at the moment mainly with wikipedia sites, therefore I suggest you to test it with one of these.

## Technologies used

The main function of my application is based on these packages:
- [andreaskrey/readability.php](https://github.com/andreskrey/readability.php)
- [kub-at/php-simple-html-dom-parser](https://github.com/Kub-AT/php-simple-html-dom-parser)

## Known Issues
- There is a problem with JavaScript on Android. If you test it there, you won't be able to toogle the input fields and can't add texts or folders.
