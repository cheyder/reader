## About
Reading requires simplicity and a uniform appearance in order to be able to devote as much attention as possible to the content. Digital texts rarely meet these requirements. This reader downloads articles from the Internet and presents them in a minimalist design to bring the content of the text to the fore.

## Background

This is my graduation project from web devevlopment bootcamp at neuefische Hamburg: A distraction free reader. You can test it [here](https://cheyder.uber.space) (no guarantee for permanent storage of any user data so far). 

The crawler works at the moment mainly with wikipedia sites, therefore I suggest you to test it with one of these.

## Technologies used

The main function of my application is based on these packages:
- [andreaskrey/readability.php](https://github.com/andreskrey/readability.php)
- [kub-at/php-simple-html-dom-parser](https://github.com/Kub-AT/php-simple-html-dom-parser)

## Known Issues
- There is a problem with JavaScript on Android. If you test it there, you won't be able to toogle the input fields and can't add texts or folders.
